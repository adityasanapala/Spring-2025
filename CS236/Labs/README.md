# Lab 1 (Jan 6)


# Tasks: In this lab, you must do the following.

- Get comfortable installing and running xv6 in the lab machines, and if you need it, on your personal laptops. Instructions are here: https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~mythili/os/xv6.html
- Get comfortable with writing and running C programs on Linux. I hope most of you will be able to write a simple program that prints "Hello world" to screen in C. If you cannot, some instructions to do so are here (accessible via SSO).
- Get started on the lab "Introduction to Linux Tools" on the course webpage. Work through as many problems as you can. We will continue this lab next week as well, as we have not covered all concepts required for this lab in class yet.
# Grading: TAs will ask you for a simple demo at the end of the lab and award marks as follows.

- 1 mark for showing that you can build and run xv6, 1 mark for showing that you can compile and run a simple "hello world" C program on Linux. 

# Lab 2 (Jan 13)

- Complete the lab "Introduction to Linux tools"
- Start the lab "Shell" on the course webpage. Complete warm-up exercises 1-5, and part A of the lab.

# Lab 3 (Jan 20)

Complete the remaining warm-up exercises (6-8) and remaining parts (B, C, D, E) of the lab "Shell" from the course webpage.

# Lab 4 (Feb 3)

Solve the lab "Process management in xv6" from the course webpage. Please go over the xv6 installation instructions to start running xv6 in the lab. We have updated the tarball with minor errors we saw in the first lab, so please download a new tarball from the course webpage before you start the lab.

This lab has 3 parts. You must start with part A, and we expect everyone to finish part A before you leave the lab. You can move on to parts B and C (in any order) after completing part A.

# Lab 5 (Feb 10)

Complete the xv6 process management lab from previous week.

For those who have finished the lab exercises, the TAs will post some extra practice exercises on the same topics.

# Lab 6 (Feb 17)

Solve the lab "Inter-process communication" from the course webpage. Solve the lab in the following order, so that you can solve a warmup question and the corresponding exercise together.

Warmup question #1 and part A

Warmup question #2 and part B

Warmup question #3 and part C

# Lab 7 (Mar 3)

Solve the lab titled "Memory management in xv6" from the course webpage. You must complete parts A and B, and optionally part C (after finishing A and B). 

# Lab 8 (Mar 10)

Start the lab titled "Pthreads synchronization" from the course webpage. Complete the warmup exercises and then solve part A. Move on to later parts once part A is done.

# Lab 9 (Mar 17)

Complete the remaining parts of the previous two labs (xv6 memory management and pthreads synchronization). You are expected to finish parts A and B of the xv6 memory lab, and part A of the pthreads lab at the very least, and more parts if you can.
